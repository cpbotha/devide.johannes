As explained in the johannes README.txt, porting the first stages of
johannes (python, numpy, wxpython, matplotlib) to Windows is probably
not going to happen.   However, johannes CAN build the difficult
stuff, also automatically and nicely localised in a folder.

1. First get and install all the prerequisites:
-----------------------------------------------

* Get and install Python 2.6 from [1].  This will only be used for
  bootstrapping, so a Python 2.5 should also do.
* SVN: get and install the command-line client from [2].
  The installer will modify your PATH variable. 
* CVS: get the WinCVS ZIP from http://wincvs.org/download.html then
  extract the CVSNT installer
  from there and install it.  The installer will modify your PATH
  variable.
* patch: get from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm
  and install.  Add its install directory to your path.
* Get and install the NSIS installer builder from [3].  Put its install
  directory on your system PATH.
* Visual Studio 2008: Make sure the latest service pack installed, SP1
  at the time of this writing (August 1, 2009).  Add the Visual Studio
  2008 devenv.com directory to your path.  On this win32 image,
  that's: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE

I can recommend cpbotha.net/software/envedit for easy path editing.
It's BSD open source by yours truly.

2. Now let johannes do its magic:
---------------------------------

python \where\you\put\it\bootstrap.py -w your_working_dir
your_working_dir\jpython \where\you\put\it\johannes.py -w your_working_dir

Wait a few hours.  When the build is done, results are as explained in
the RESULTS section of the main johannes README.txt file.

APPENDIX:
---------

Let's say you don't really want DeVIDE, but you'd like to use johannes
to build for example just VTK and/or ITK.  You can!

Follow all instructions under 1., then do for example:

your_working_dir\jpython \where\you\put\it\johannes.py -w your_working_dir -p itk,vtk

See johannes --help for clues to package names.
